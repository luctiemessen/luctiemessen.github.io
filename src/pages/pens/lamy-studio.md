## About the designer
Hannes Wettstein, born 10 March 1958 in Ascona Switserland - died, 5th July 2008, was one of Switserlands most important industrial designers [^ref-c]. He founded <a href="http://www.hanneswettstein.ch/">his design agency</a> in 1991. This agency was led by Stephan H端rlemann under the same name untill 2016, upon wich it was changed to <a href="https://www.huerlemann.com/">H端rlemann AG</a>.

[^ref-c]: [Suche nach den Archetypen von morgen - NNZ](https://www.nzz.ch/suche_nach_den_archetypen_von_morgen-ld.497054 "Suche nach den Archetypen von morgen").

Next to his main job as a designer was also a teacher at the prestigious <a href="https://ethz.ch/">ETH in Zurich</a> from 1991 until 1996. From 1994 until 2001 he also was a professor at <a href="https://hfg-karlsruhe.de/">Staatlichen Hochschule f端r Gestaltung Karlsruhe</a>, Germany [^ref-b].

### Scribble 
Wettstein's story with Lamy starts around 1997 with the initial sketches for the Scribble mechanical pencil. These sketches were followed up by several prototypes in 1998 and led to the final drawings in 1999 [^ref-d].

[^ref-d]: [Lamy Scribble - Bleistift Blog](https://bleistift.blog/2014/07/lamy-scribble/ "Lamy Scribble").

 In 2002 Lamy released the <em>Scribble</em> mechanical pencil REF.

Looking at this sketch you might argue that Wettstein already hinted to a propeller shape clip which later would be used on the Lamy Studio.

Apparently this process went well. Since he was asked to design another pen. This time not only limited to a pencil but a full suite of rollerball, ballpoint, twin pen (ballpoint and mechanical pencil combined) and fountain pen.

### The clip
One of the most thought about and eye catching elements of the pen is the propeller shaped clip. On all pens it is a glossy solid piece of metal that is attached on the cap of the pen.

## The launch
... probeer iets te vinden van een product launch ... 
Probably 2004 November 2004 was hij op de site van Lamy
https://web.archive.org/web/20041112035205/http://www.lamy.com/

The initial launch of the Lamy Studio netted 3 versions of the Studio. The Palladium (model no. 68), Brushed steel (65) and Black (67). More about the model numbers below. But what I find the most interesting about this initial release is that the 3 models all have different sections. The Palladium has this textured finish on the section, the steel has the black rubberized section and the black has the polished section. I w

### Model numbers
Most Lamy pens follow the same modelnumber structure with 3 digits. Their position and number have a specific meaning. 

The first digit defines the <em>pen type</em> with 0 for fountain pen and 1 for mechanical pencil, 3 for ballpoint and so on. The second digit identifies the <em>pen model</em>. The Lamy 2000 for example is identified with a zero (0) as well as the Logo. The Safari and Vista are identified with 1, cp1 with 5 and Studio has 6. The last digit is for the <em>pen finish</em> and I am under the impression that Lamy tries to keep them similar across models but obviously these finishes are mostly unique to a specific model, in this case the Lamy Studio. Where the brushed steel is identified with a 5 and the Violet and Royal red (and I believe most special editions). 8 is used for the Palladium and Platinum grey.

<div class="span2-4">

So with these numbers you could identify a Lamy Studio Platinum ballpoint with the 269 model number. The fountain pen model number (0) is not used so the Brushed steel Studio is just referenced to as 65 and not 065.

I am under the impression that they try to align these finish numbers across models but I'm not really sure. I also see some discrepancies between finishes. The 6 for the cp1 model is the matte black finish but for the Studio they use the 7 for the black (and blue) finish. <ref>ask lamy</ref>.

## Ballpoint redesign
Snapshot van 16 April 2014 heeft de Imperial Blue met het nieuwe design van de balpen. De Platinum grey, brushed, Palladium, Black en Platinum waren nog in het oude design van de balpen.

Aanname dat 2015 alles om is naar nieuw design. 
Snapshot van 18 september 2015 staat alleen de Platinum nog op de site met het oude bp design. 
Platinum Grey zit niet meer in het assortiment. Alleen Black, Imp Blue, Brushed, Palladium en Platinum

## Words of gratitude
Throughout this article I've used several sources, when directly cited, these are listed in the Footnotes, but some sources have been so essential that a simple footnote does not suffice to express my gratitude. These are listed below.
