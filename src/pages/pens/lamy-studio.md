  <p class="lead">Information about the Lamy Studio
</p>

## Introduction
The Lamy Studio is a pen introduced in 2005 by Lamy and was placed in their premium product lineup. The pen was designed by renowed designer <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannes_Wettstein" title="Hannes Wettstein Wikipedia">Hannes Wettstein</a> and has since its introduction received several design awards. In 2005 the Good Design Award [ref needed] and in 2006 the iF award [^ref-a].

## About the designer
Hannes Wettstein, born 10 March 1958 in Ascona Switserland - died, 5th July 2008, was one of Switserlands most important industrial designers [^ref-c]. He founded <a href="http://www.hanneswettstein.ch/">his design agency</a> in 1991. This agency was led by Stephan Hürlemann under the same name untill 2016, upon wich it was changed to <a href="https://www.huerlemann.com/">Hürlemann AG</a>.

[^ref-c]: [Suche nach den Archetypen von morgen - NNZ](https://www.nzz.ch/suche_nach_den_archetypen_von_morgen-ld.497054 "Suche nach den Archetypen von morgen").

Next to his main job as a designer was also a teacher at the prestigious <a href="https://ethz.ch/">ETH in Zurich</a> from 1991 until 1996. From 1994 until 2001 he also was a professor at <a href="https://hfg-karlsruhe.de/">Staatlichen Hochschule für Gestaltung Karlsruhe</a>, Germany [^ref-b].

### Scribble 
Wettstein's story with Lamy starts around 1997 with the initial sketches for the Scribble mechanical pencil. These sketches were followed up by several prototypes in 1998 and led to the final drawings in 1999 [^ref-d].

[^ref-d]: [Lamy Scribble - Bleistift Blog](https://bleistift.blog/2014/07/lamy-scribble/ "Lamy Scribble").

 In 2002 Lamy released the <em>Scribble</em> mechanical pencil <ref/>.

Looking at this sketch you might argue that Wettstein already hinted to a propeller shape clip which later would be used on the Lamy Studio.

Apparently this process went well. Since he was asked to design another pen[ref needed]. This time not only limited to a pencil but a full suite of rollerball, ballpoint, twin pen (ballpoint and mechanical pencil combined) and fountain pen.

## The launch
... probeer iets te vinden van een product launch ... 
Probably 2004 November 2004 was hij op de site van Lamy
https://web.archive.org/web/20041112035205/http://www.lamy.com/

The initial launch of the Lamy Studio netted 3 versions of the Studio. The Palladium (model no. 68), Brushed steel (65) and Black (67). More about the model numbers below. But what I find the most interesting about this initial release is that the 3 models all have different sections. The Palladium has this textured finish on the section, the steel has the black rubberized section and the black has the polished section. I w

### Model numbers
Most Lamy pens follow the same modelnumber structure with 3 digits. Their position and number have a specific meaning. 

```
1st digit: Pen type
2nd digit: Pen model
3rd digit: Pen finish
```

For the first digit (pen type) there are the following variants

```
0: Fountain pen (not used in the model number)
1: Mechanical pencil
2: Ballpoint
3: Rollerball
4: Multi color ballpoint
5: Fineliner
6: Twin pen (and tri-pen?)
```

For the second digit (pen model) I don't aim to be complete here but we know the following numbers are linked to the following models.

```
0: Lamy 2000, Logo
1: Safari, Vista
2: Pur, Linea, AL-star
3: Swift
4: st
5: cp1
6: Studio
7: Dialog
8: Scribble, Pico
```

Finally the finish digit. 

```
5: Brushed steel
6: Matte Black, All black LX, Violet, Royal red
7: Black, Blue
8: Palladium, Platinum Grey, Piano black
9: Platinum, Dark Brown
```

<ref>Hier afbeelding van maken</ref>

So with these numbers you could identify a Lamy Studio Platinum ballpoint with the 269 model number. The fountain pen model number (0) is not used so the Brushed steel Studio is just referenced to as 65 and not 065. 

I am under the impression that they try to align these finish numbers across models but I'm not really sure. I also see some discrepancies between finishes. The 6 for the cp1 model is the matte black finish but for the Studio they use the 7 for the black (and blue) finish. <ref>ask lamy</ref>. 


The Palladium was launched with a 14k nib. The pen was available with an EF, F, M, B, OM or OB nib. The black and brushed steel

## Ballpoint redesign
Snapshot van 16 April 2014 heeft de Imperial Blue met het nieuwe design van de balpen. De Platinum grey, brushed, Palladium, Black en Platinum waren nog in het oude design van de balpen.

Aanname dat 2015 alles om is naar nieuw design. 
Snapshot van 18 september 2015 staat alleen de Platinum nog op de site met het oude bp design. 
Platinum Grey zit niet meer in het assortiment. Alleen Black, Imp Blue, Brushed, Palladium en Platinum

## Questions for Wettstein Studio and/or Lamy
- When did the initial design process start for the studio?
- What was the assignment from Lamy? Did Wettstein get a carte blanche from Lamy?
- What was the problem statement Wettstein used when coming up with a design for this pen?
- How did the design process look like?
- How many design iterations and/or prototypes were made?
- What were the challenges with the production of the pen?
- When was the initial release of the pen?
- What made Wettstein decide to have 3 types of sections 1 glossy chrome and 1 rubber/plastic (and later palladium)
- Was Wettstein involved in every evolvement of the pen (for example the platinum version)
- How did the redesign of the ballpoint come into being?


## Words of gratitude
Throughout this article I've used several sources, when directly cited, these are listed in the Footnotes, but some sources have been so essential that a simple footnote does not suffice to express my gratitude. These are listed below. 

<a href="https://bleistift.blog/2014/07/lamy-scribble/">Lamy Scribble</a> from Bleistift.blog. This has helped a ton for drafting the background on the Scribble pen.
